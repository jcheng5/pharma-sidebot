Welcome to the data dashboard! I'm here to help you explore and analyze the data. Here are some examples of what you can ask me to do:

* "Filter the dashboard to show only subjects older than 65."
* "What is the average baseline BMI?"
* "Find subjects who discontinued due to an adverse event."

Feel free to ask any specific questions or request assistance with filtering and sorting the data.
